# Project Name
There are more than 200 various types of cancer. Melanoma is the most deadly type of skin cancer out of 200 different types. Clinical screening is the first step in the melanoma detection process, which is then followed by dermoscopic analysis and histological investigation.
Skin cancer with melanoma has a good chance of being cured if it is discovered in its nascent stages. Visual inspection of the afflicted area of skin is the initial stage in the diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer.
Dermatologists use a high-speed camera to capture dermatoscopic images of skin lesions, which have an accuracy of 65â€“80% in the diagnosis of melanoma without any additional technical assistance. The overall accuracy of melanoma diagnosis increased to 75-84% with additional visual assessment by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic pictures.
In order to categorise skin cancer using photographs of skin lesions, the project intends to develop an automated classification system based on image processing techniques.

## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion
